# CleanBeam
This is a simple tool to help clean your BeamNG.drive cache without going into the launcher or deleting it manually.

This software should work as long as the devs do not fundamentally change how the cache system works,
I've put extra effort into redundancies for this to remain future-proof no matter which version of the game you're on.
