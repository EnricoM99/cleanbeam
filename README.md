# CleanBeam

This is a simple tool written in PowerShell to help clean your BeamNG.drive cache without having to verify your files through the launcher or deleting it manually.

This software should work as long as the devs do not fundamentally change how the cache system works,
I've put extra effort into redundancies for this to remain future-proof no matter which version of BeamNG.drive you're on.
